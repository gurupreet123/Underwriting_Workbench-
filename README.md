🛡️ Underwriting Workbench+ (The Next-Gen Risk Command Center)Project OverviewThe Underwriting Workbench+ is a Hybrid GenAI System designed to solve the critical operational bottleneck of manual risk assessment in commercial insurance.This solution transforms the time-consuming process of synthesizing messy, unstructured applicant data (PDFs, claims histories, broker notes) into a rapid, consistent, and explainable decision within seconds. It is built on an advanced Agentic Architecture using LangChain and a secure, local-first LLM deployment, ensuring high data privacy and enterprise reliability.Key Differentiators & Advanced FeaturesFeatureTechnical BenefitBusiness ValueMulti-Agent OrchestrationUses RunnableParallel to run 3 specialist LLM chains concurrently (Claims, Profile, External).90% Faster initial triage time and high throughput.Structured Guardrails (Pydantic)Enforces exact JSON output schemas using Pydantic, validated before synthesis.100% Reliability and consistency in scoring; eliminates UI crashes from AI output errors.Robust PDF IngestionCustom Python Regex pipeline to clean and re-join broken, stair-step text from tables/columns in PDF uploads.Enables analysis of real-world, messy documentation instantly.Hybrid LLM EngineRuns Llama 3 locally via Ollama for PII data, providing seamless Zero Data Leakage.Zero API Cost for core analysis, meets strict compliance requirements.Explainability DashboardVisualizes risk contribution using Plotly Radar Charts and cites the specific specialist agent responsible.Increases underwriter trust and provides clear audit trails.💻 Architecture & Technical ComponentsThe system follows a scalable, decoupled architecture where the UI and intelligence operate independently.1. The Agentic Brain (LangChain)The core logic is managed by a three-tiered agent pipeline:Specialist Agents (Parallel): Three separate LLM chains analyze the same raw text simultaneously:Claims: Focuses on loss frequency/severity/recency.Profile: Focuses on credit score, business tenure, and industry risk.External: Focuses on public record violations and legal flags.RAG-Lite Injection: The final Synthesis Agent is injected with dynamic Underwriting Guidelines (RAG) to enforce company policy during decision-making.Synthesis: The Synthesis Agent aggregates the three structured risk scores into the final composite score and recommendation.2. Frontend & DeploymentComponentRoleNotesStreamlit UIPresentation LayerProvides a clean, multi-page web application (Dashboard, Deep Dive, Analytics).PDF ProcessorData IngestionUses pypdf + custom Regex to clean and prepare text for the LLM.Audit LogPersistenceEvery decision (score, recommendation) is logged for auditability and session history.🚀 Getting Started (Local Demo)Follow these steps to set up and run the application locally for demonstration.PrerequisitesYou must have Python 3.10+ installed and the Ollama application running on your machine.Install the LLM: Open your terminal and pull the required model:ollama pull llama3:8b
Install Dependencies:pip install streamlit langchain-ollama pydantic pypdf streamlit-option-menu plotly
ExecutionEnsure the Ollama server is running (check your menu bar).Navigate to the project directory in your terminal.Run the application:streamlit run workbench_app.py
